I create the front of a Game Boy.

The gameboy is interactive so you can turn it on in the top button.
In the screen will start the Pokemon Yellow game.

After you see the animation at the beginning you will see a screen with a press start, so lets try it!

After you click start you will have two options. You can decide which one you want, press A to select. 

When you press A, it appear the "low battery" screen and the console will turn off.

In a future I`ll like to imrprove the project by cleaning the code and adding more things of the original game.

 ### BUGS ###

 Right now the only bug i found its that if you turn the console off and on In less than 4s. The screen will reproduce two animations at the same time.
